# jsGames
A simple JavaScript memory game using HTML and CSS
The 'onClick' event calls the function showImage(). When the number of opened images = 2, the images are compared. If they are same, the visibility of the images is set to 'hidden'.
The number of clicks are counted and are displayed at the end of the game.
